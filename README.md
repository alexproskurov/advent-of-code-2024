# Advent of Code 2024 🎄  

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions repository! This is where I tackle daily coding challenges, refine my programming skills, and have fun with holiday-themed puzzles.  

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is an annual event where a new programming puzzle is released every day in December, leading up to Christmas. It's a fantastic way to challenge yourself, explore new algorithms, and improve problem-solving skills.  

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:  

```plaintext
📂 advent-of-code-2024  
├── 📁 dayN   
│   ├── dayN.go            # Go implementation for Day N  
│   ├── dayN_test.go       # Unit tests for Day N solution  
├── README.md              # Project documentation  
```

## Goals

1. Write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.  
2. Experiment with different algorithms and approaches.  
3. Document learnings and improvements after solving each puzzle.  

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Go  
- **Testing Framework:** `testing` (Go's standard testing library)
